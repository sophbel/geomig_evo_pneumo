## Geographic migration and vaccine-induced fitness changes of *Streptococcus pneumoniae*
The first two folders pertain to the two main components of this paper and the third folder contains the data for figures. <br />
1) Geographic Analysis including human mobility model and relative risk framework:  ```./HumanMobility_RR/```
2) Fitness Model quantifying the relative fitness over time of serotypes individually, grouped by whether they are vaccine type or non-vaccine type, and penicillin susceptibility: ```./Fitness/```
3) Figures and source code for all figures. ```./Figures/```


*Unfortunately these each require different versions of R. The best workaround is to create two separate conda environments each with the R versions you want in them in which you can open individual RStudios or just run from the command line*
